# hello-world

Hi, i'm David Abekasis, 
i'm excited on home automation projects, several factors are taken into account:
1. it involves software
2. it combines hardware (IoT)
3. it involves my kids that i can get them interested into this world.
4. i'm planning on using this new skills for contributing to the community with this projects:
   like: Raspi, Arduino to make incredible stuff and learn.
